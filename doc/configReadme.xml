As a Salesforce admin I want to migrate Opportunities from one Salesforce organization to another one.

This Anypoint template serves as a foundation for the process of migrating Opportunities from one Salesforce instance to another, being able to specify filtering criteria and desired behavior when an Opportunity already exists in the destination org. 

As implemented, this template leverages the Mule batch module.

The batch job is divided in *Process* and *On Complete* stages.

Migration process starts from fetching all the existing Opportunities that match the filter criteria from Salesforce Org A.
On *Process* stage matched opportunities will be grouped and inserted or updated in Salesforce Org B.

Finally during the *On Complete* stage the template will both output statistics data into the console and send a notification email with the results of the batch execution.

To make this template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both, that must be made for the template to run smoothly. 
**Failing to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

Once your app is all set and started, supposing you choose as domain name `sfdcOpportunitymigration` to trigger the use case you just need to browse to `http://sfdcOpportunitymigration.cloudhub.io/migrateopportunities` and report will be sent to the emails configured.

		<section id="running_on_standalone">

After this, to trigger the use case you just need to browse to the local http endpoint with the port you configured in your file. If this is, for instance, `9090` then you should browse to: `http://localhost:9090/migrateopportunities` and this will create a CSV report and send it to the mails set.

**HTTP Connector Configuration**
+ http.port `9090` 

**Batch Aggregator Configuration**
+ page.size `1000`

**Account Sync Policy**
+ account.sync.policy `syncAccount`

**Note:** the property **account.sync.policy** can take any of the two following values: 

+ **empty_value**: if the propety has no value assigned to it then application will do nothing in what respect to the account and it'll just move the opportunity over.
+ **syncAccount**: it will try to create the opportunity's account if this is not pressent in the Salesforce instance B.

**Salesforce Connector configuration for company A**
+ sfdc.a.username `bob.dylan@orga`
+ sfdc.a.password `DylanPassword123`
+ sfdc.a.securityToken `avsfwCUl7apQs56Xq2AKi3X`

**Salesforce Connector configuration for company B**
+ sfdc.b.username `joan.baez@orgb`
+ sfdc.b.password `JoanBaez456`

		<section id="api_calls">
		
Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to consider. The template calls to the API can be calculated using the formula:

***1 + X + X / ${page.size}***

Being ***X*** the number of Opportunities to be synchronized on each run. 

The division by ***${page.size}*** is because, by default, Opportunities are gathered in groups of ${page.size} for each Upsert API Call in the commit step.

For instance if 10 records are fetched from origin instance, then 12 api calls will be made (1 + 10 + 1).

This file provides the inbound and outbound sides of your integration app.
This template has only an [HTTP Inbound Endpoint](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/HTTP+Endpoint+Reference) as the way to trigger the use case.

$H$H#  Inbound Flow
**HTTP Inbound Endpoint** - Start Report Generation

+ `${http.port}` is set as a property to be defined either on a property file or in CloudHub environment variables.
+ The path configured by default is `migrateopportunities` and you are free to change for the one you prefer.
+ The host name for all endpoints in your CloudHub configuration should be defined as `localhost`. CloudHub will then route requests from your application domain URL to the endpoint.
+ The endpoint is configured as a *request-response* since as a result of calling it the response will be the total of Opportunities synced and filtered by the criteria specified.

		<section id="default_business_logic_xml">
		
Functional aspect of the template is implemented on this XML, directed by one flow responsible of excecuting the logic.
For the purpose of this particular Template the *mainFlow* uses a batch job, which handles all the logic of it.
